# KinetoFun — Architecture Decisions

> Permanent technical decisions. **Append-only — no decision is ever overwritten.**

## ADR-001 — Frontend stack: Next.js + React
**Date:** 2026-06-08
**Status:** Accepted
**Decision:** Build the web-first frontend with Next.js and React, optimized for a TV / large-screen interface.
**Rationale:** Mandated by the PRD. Next.js provides routing, SSR/SSG options, and a strong React ecosystem suitable for a TV UI.

## ADR-002 — Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
**Date:** 2026-06-08
**Status:** Accepted (deferred to Phase 2)
**Decision:** Use Supabase PostgreSQL for backend storage (users, scores, sessions).
**Rationale:** Mandated by the PRD. Supabase provides managed Postgres plus auth/storage primitives.

## ADR-003 — Authentication: JWT
**Date:** 2026-06-08
**Status:** Accepted (deferred to Phase 2)
**Decision:** Use JWT-based authentication.
**Rationale:** Mandated by the PRD.

## ADR-004 — Phased delivery
**Date:** 2026-06-08
**Status:** Accepted
**Decision:** Deliver in four phases: (1) Frontend first with mocked backend, (2) Backend integration, (3) Game system, (4) Hardware input layer.
**Rationale:** Mandated by the PRD. Lets the UI stabilize before backend and hardware complexity is introduced.

## ADR-005 — AI development workflow rules
**Date:** 2026-06-08
**Status:** Accepted
**Decision:** Every change cycle must:
1. Read `project-context.md` and `project-roadmap.md` before acting.
2. Never rebuild existing features unless explicitly told to.
3. Never assume missing information.
4. Update `project-context.md` after every feature completion.
5. Update `project-roadmap.md` whenever a task changes state.
6. Record decisions/assumptions here (append-only).
**Rationale:** Mandated by the PRD. Ensures context survives across sessions so work can resume after long gaps without re-explanation.

## ADR-006 — Branch strategy
**Date:** 2026-06-08
**Status:** Accepted
**Decision:** `main` = stable production, `dev` = active development. Features merge only after testing.
**Rationale:** Mandated by the PRD.
**Note:** This directory is not yet a git repository. Git init + branch setup is a pending task.

## ADR-007 — Phase 1 scaffold: Next.js App Router + TypeScript + Tailwind + ESLint
**Date:** 2026-06-08
**Status:** Accepted
**Decision:** Scaffolded with `create-next-app@latest` using: App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, ESLint, `src/` directory, and the `@/*` import alias. Package name `kinetofun`.
**Resolved versions:** Next.js 16.2.7, React 19.2.4, Tailwind CSS v4, ESLint 9, TypeScript 5. Runtime: Node v24.16.0.
**Rationale:** Confirmed with the user (App Router + TS + Tailwind). `src/` dir + `@/*` alias keep imports clean and leave room for a clear backend/UI split in later phases.
**Notes:**
- Node v16.14.2 (original, EOL) was a blocker; user upgraded to Node v24.16.0 before scaffolding (roadmap blocker now resolved).
- npm hit `UNABLE_TO_VERIFY_LEAF_SIGNATURE` (TLS interception / missing root CA); worked around with `NODE_OPTIONS=--use-system-ca`. **Future installs on this machine may need the same flag.**
- Scaffolded into a temp lowercase dir then moved into the project root, because `create-next-app` rejects the capitalized folder name `kinetoFun` and refuses non-empty target dirs.
